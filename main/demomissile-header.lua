-- than your missiles' max range or re-locking onto targets your missiles
-- can't hit (e.g. torpedoes re-locking onto air targets).

-- Optional weapon slot to fire. If non-nil then an LWC is not needed.
-- However, script-fired weapons aren't governed by failsafes, so keep
-- that in mind...
-- Missile controllers on turrets should be assigned the same weapon slot
-- as their turret block.

-- 1 = Focus on highest priority target
