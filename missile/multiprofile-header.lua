-- MULTI PROFILE CONFIGURATION

-- Also see https://github.com/ZerothAngel/FtDScripts/blob/master/missile/multiprofile.md

-- How it works:

-- Each profile can select Lua transceivers in one of three ways:
--   By launcher orientation (vertical, horizontal)
--   By launcher direction (right, left, up, down, forward, back)
--   By weapon slot of the missile controller within a given distance

-- If a Lua transceiver potentially matches multiple profiles, then:
--   1. A matching profile that uses weapon slot/distance selection
--      always wins
--   2. Otherwise the first matching profile (going down the list)
--      will be used

-- If a Lua transceiver matches no profiles (due to damage or
-- misconfiguration), then the 1st profile is used.

-- Remember that subconstructs (turrets, spinners) have their own axes
-- independent of the main vehicle. This may make selection by
-- orientation/direction surprising(!).

-- See https://github.com/ZerothAngel/FtDScripts/blob/master/missile/generalmissile.md for details about generalmissile configuration (the "Config" sections).

--         -- where <dir> is back, down, forward, left, right, up
--         -- Note that it must be a list even with a single direction.
--         Direction = { Vector3.left, Vector3.right },

--         -- on the same subconstruct.
--         Name = "MyMissile",
--      },
      -- Set to a number 1-5 to have the script fire this weapon slot itself.
      -- An LWC is not needed in that case. However, script-fired weapons
